# FriendFinder

_Answer a survey to find a match friend._

## To start🚀

_Install npm modules, in console_

```
npm install
```

_Run the aplication, in console_

```
node server.js
```

_Run the port, in the browser_

```
localhost:8080
```

### How it works ⌨️

_Before we start doing the survey, we have some data in a .js file (our api). We do the survey and every question has its own points, at the end, we compare the data that we had with our points. The person with the less difference of points comparing with us, is our match friend. Once you finish, your result will store in a api, so it will be comparable with the next users that answer the survey in the future._
_Once you finish your survey, open the browser console to see the detail._

_Take a look to the stored data, run in the browser_

```
localhost:8080/api/friends
```
